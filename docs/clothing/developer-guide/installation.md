## Inserting the panel

To add the Clothing Panel to your game, first click the button below to get taken to Roblox's Marketplace page. On there, press the `Get Model` button. This will add the panel to your toolbox.

When you're in Roblox Studio, open the Toolbox by pressing the `Toolbox` button on the top bar. Go to the `My Models` tab and search for `Clothing Panel`. Drag the model from the Toolbox to the game window and you're done!

## Changing game settings

If you want to be able to browse the outfits in Studio, you'll need to enable `Studio Access to API Services` in the `Game Settings` window.

It's not possible to create outfits in Studio. This is because text filtering is disabled in Studio.
