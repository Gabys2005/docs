# Changing clothes

## Shirts, pants or accessories

To wear shirts, pants or accessories, press the `Add shirts, pants or accessories` button. In the popup, insert the ID of the item you want to wear and press `Submit`. Both classic and 3D clothing works.

## Faces

Faces are changed the same way as above, but with the `Change face` button

## Animations

Same as above, but with the `Change animations` button. You can use both individual animations (jump animations, run animations, ...) and animation bundles (for example the Ninja pack).

## Body parts

Same as above, but with the `Change body parts` button. You need to insert the body parts one by one (left leg, right leg, left arm, ...)

## Skin color

To change skin color, press the `Change skin color` button and select the skin color you want to use.

## Width, height and depth

You can customise your character's width, height and depth in the `Adjust body scaling` menu.

## Removing clothes

To remove clothes or accessories, press the `Clothing remover` button. Wait a few seconds for everything to load. In the popup, you can press the trash bin icon next to each item to remove it.

## Refreshing your character

You can refresh your character by pressing the `Refresh character` button. This will respawn you while keeping your position in the game and your tools.
