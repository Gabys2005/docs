# Intro

This is a small tutorial for people who aren't experienced with scripts showing how to add a basic GIF panel and screens. I expect you to have at least _some_ experience with Roblox Studio.

Everything in the `Inserting the player and panel` and `Configuring the screens` sections needs to be done only once per game (\*or per screens if you plan to include many GIF panels).

Everything in the `Adding GIFs` section needs to be done once per GIF.

Some screenshots might not match up exactly with others because I took them on multiple separate occasions. Videos might come soon.
