# Problems

If you're having problems with anything, you can DM me on Discord for help. My tag is `.gabys` (with the dot).

Please try to add some details to your message, `it doesn't work` is not helpful at all. To make it easier for me to find the issue please do the following:

1. Tell me what you did before it breaking - what did you edit, what did you insert, did you follow the guide?
2. Send me the **full** output log. You can get more information about the output [HERE](https://support.gabys.xyz/general/output)
