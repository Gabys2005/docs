# Generating sprite sheets

Roblox doesn't allow users to upload GIF files, so to work around that, you need to convert your GIFs into sprite sheets. You can use a website like https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite to do that.

:::tip
Try to keep your sheets as square as possible.

:::tip
Having more than 100 frames in a single sheet will make the GIF **very** blurred. Split your GIF into multiple sprite sheets to avoid that.
